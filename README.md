# cms-icons
SVG icons and font for the Advanced CMS project (Bluefoot)

Uses https://github.com/sapegin/grunt-webfont to build the icon font and the CSS classes from the folder of SVG images.

## Working with the project

Run 'sudo npm install' in the root of the project and then run 'grunt' to build the icons.

Any improvements or suggestions are welcome ;-)
